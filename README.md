My Role: Co-developer (2-person team) - Designed the data processing pipeline and implemented the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) library for audio synchronization. Collaborated on system architecture and visualization components.   
Built For: University of Victoria Course Project (Jan-Mar 2025)

### Features
- Audio synchronization using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm
- Real-time pitch visualization dashboard
- Comparison of live performance against reference recordings
- Video playback with synchronized pitch analysis
### Technologies Used
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Machine Learning** - Dynamic Time Warping for audio sync
- **Data Visualization** - Real-time pitch comparison
- **Audio Processing** - Signal analysis and feature extraction


## Data Visualizations
### Greater Victoria Average Property Cost - **Tableau**  
Interactive map visualization analyzing real estate trends across Greater Victoria municipalities.

Key Insight:  
- Why is downtown Victoria less expensive than other municipalities? -> Many properties in Victoria are single/two bedroom condos, whereas many properties outside of Victoria tend to be fully detatched homes.

Key Insight:  
- Where should I look for Data Analyst jobs? -> This question depends on what you value, for example Toronto has drastically more positions needing to be filled but Vancouver has a higher average salary. Toronto may be better for entry level roles, while Vancouver may be better for established Data Analysts.
